# Flight Delay Prediction

# Problem Statement and Objective
Flight delays have become an important subject and problem for air transportation systems all over the world. The aviation industry is continuing to suffer from economic losses associated with flight delays all the time. According to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of the United States, more than 20% of U.S. flights were delayed in 2018. These flight delays have a severe economic impact in the U.S. which is equivalent to 40.7 billion dollars per year.

Passengers suffer a loss of time and missed business opportunities or leisure activities, and airlines attempting to make up for delays leads to extra fuel consumption and a larger adverse environmental impact. In order to alleviate the negative economic and environmental impacts caused by unexpected flight delays, and balance increasing flight demand with growing flight delays, an accurate prediction of flight delays in airports is needed.

Reasons for Airport delays may result from airline operations, air traffic congestion, weather, air traffic management initiatives, etc. Most of the reasons are stochastic phenomena that are difficult to predict timely and accurate. So it is important for us to utilize machine learning to help us to predict the delay of airlines.

Thus, we aim to use several Machine Learning techniques to predict whether the flight will be delayed or not. Out of all the ML algorithms that we use, we will find the best model to perform hyperparameter tuning and increase its accuracy.
